Around the corner & down the street There lives a black cat w/ snowy feet His ears alert & his tail does flow Whiskers as long as they could grow Sometimes we’d see him on the roof Then suddenly gone — poof! On the dock to view the scene He’s the sweetest cat we’ve ever seen!
Our absolutely favorite toys — @SaMindy4 ’s Crochet Catnip Snakes are the best (plus the sales help with Sammy’s diabetes meds!). ❤️ 🐍 🐾 — Hazel and Remy
We are at the lake And it’s a rain break A storm is in the air Shucks that’s not fair Remy does a test run Says it soon it won’t be fun Treats are a must before the storm So inside we go to get all warm. Happy day! ❤️🐾 — Hazel
